# üí´ About Me

Hi, I'm **Zach**, a student of **Mathematics and Computer Science** with a strong focus on **data in all its forms**‚Äîhow it's generated, structured, analyzed, and leveraged for decision-making.

My interests lie at the intersection of **data engineering**, **analytics**, and **computational modeling**. I'm particularly drawn to building systems that make data **useful, interpretable, and scalable**‚Äîwhether through simulation pipelines, statistical models, or dashboards that tell compelling stories.

This GitHub showcases projects that reflect this vision:
- **Synthetic data generation**
- **Realistic simulation frameworks**
- **Monte Carlo-based risk modeling**
- **Data cleaning and transformation tools**
- **Interactive dashboards and analytics workflows**

I bring a mathematically rigorous yet pragmatic mindset to every project, aiming to bridge theory with real-world execution. Whether it‚Äôs modeling uncertainty, designing analytical architectures, or making sense of messy datasets, I work toward creating tools that make **complex data challenges approachable and meaningful**.
