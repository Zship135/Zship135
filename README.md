# About Me

Hi, I'm **Zach**, a student of **Mathematics and Computer Science** at **Baldwin Wallace University** near Cleveland, OH.

I am primarily a Python developer but have experience in R and SQL through my academics. This comes from a class I took on statistics in R which covered Monte Carlo Simulation and hypothesis testing. I also use R for my capstone research, where we leverage R for machine learning and data cleaning tasks for the ASPCA. 
I have taken a couple courses that are SQL based, namely, data systems and database: theory, application, and security.
